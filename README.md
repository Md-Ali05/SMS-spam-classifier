# SMS Spam Classifier

This project is a SMS spam classifier that utilizes a Kaggle dataset for training the model and predicting whether a given SMS message is spam or not. The model is based on the Naive Bayes classification algorithm. Additionally, a user interface (UI) has been developed using Streamlit to provide an interactive platform for users to input messages and obtain predictions.

## Usage

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the SMS spam classifier:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
https://github.com/Md-Ali05/SMS-spam-classifier.git
cd sms-spam-classifier
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python dependencies using pip:

```
cd sms-spam-classifier
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the Dataset

Download the SMS spam dataset from Kaggle (or provide your own dataset).

### 4. Run the Streamlit App

Run the Streamlit app using the following command:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will start and provide a URL (usually http://localhost:8501) for accessing the interface.
